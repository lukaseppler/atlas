{"name":"Atlas","tagline":"Understanding life, freedom, property and happiness","body":"# atlas\r\n\r\nWe're building up an understanding of the world, from the ground up. The goal is to build an atlas supporting rational living in this world, consisting of a lexicon, advice, interpretations, and ultimately law texts.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to fork this repository and add to it, sending us pull requests with your modifications and additions to whatever part you think is lacking clarity or content. This copy is our version and under our prerogative, and you're free to let yours grow in a different direction if you please. We will aim to integrate as much as possible here, as long as it fits our interpretations of reality and reason. You can do the same.\r\n\r\nWe will work to find a common, integrated understanding of everything relevant to life, freedom, property and happiness.\r\n\r\nWe're orienting ourselves around objectivism, the American constitution, and further rational analysis.\r\n\r\nWe are explicitly against forming dogmas. Everything can be challenged. The method of forking and merging allows this in an open form. Nothing can be assumed true without integrated reasoning.\r\n\r\nIt is our hope that this work will result in an improved common understanding of the world.\r\n\r\nWe use Github: Whenever a system has replication, mutation and selection, evolution is the necessary consequence. On Github, we have forking, editing and pull requests. We can use this to ensure evolution of this project.\r\n\r\n## What can you do?\r\n\r\n1. Start reading the pages here. Maybe the one about [Rationality](Rationality.md)? Follow the links.\r\n2. Edit the pages. Github gives you the opportunity to send a pull request whenever you edit. This will alert us and allows discussion of the proposed change, or we can just accept the change into our repository.\r\n3. Fork the repository: You can take your own copy to edit. This way you can add a page, refer to it from an existing page. Treat it like a wiki, albeit a distributed one which has several forks and branches.\r\nAgain, send us a pull request with your work.\r\n\r\n## Open questions about this page\r\n\r\n* One thought is that we want to fill the gap from abandonment of social dogmas, religion or fixed hierarchy. How can this be put here without painting a negative picture of those things we abandoned?\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
