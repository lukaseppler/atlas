> Independence is the recognition of the fact
 * that yours is the responsibility of judgment and nothing can help you escape it
 * that no substitute can do your thinking, as no pinch-hitter can live your life
 * that the vilest form of self-abasement and self-destruction is the subordination of your mind to the mind of another, the acceptance of an authority over your brain, the acceptance of his assertions as facts, his say-so as truth, his edicts as middle-man between your consciousness and your existence.

*Galt's Speech, Atlas Shrugged*
