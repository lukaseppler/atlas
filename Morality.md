> My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existence exists-and in a single choice: to live. The rest proceeds from these.   
> To live, man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life: Reason – Purpose – Self-esteem.
* Reason, as his only tool of knowledge
* Purpose, as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve
* Self-esteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living.

> These three values imply and require all of man’s virtues, and all his virtues pertain to the relation of existence and consciousness:
* [rationality](Rationality.md),
* [independence](Independence.md),
* [integrity](Integrity.md),
* [honesty](Honesty.md),
* [justice](Justice.md),
* [productiveness](Productiveness.md),
* [pride](Pride.md).
