> Integrity is the recognition of the fact
* that you cannot fake your consciousness, just as honesty is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existence
* that man is an indivisible entity, an integrated unit of two attributes: of matter and consciousness, and that he may permit no breach between body and mind, between action and thought, between his life and his convictions
* that, like a judge impervious to public opinion, he may not sacrifice his convictions to the wishes of others, be it the whole of mankind shouting pleas or threats against him
* that courage and confidence are practical necessities, that courage is the practical form of being true to existence, of being true to oneâ€™s own consciousness.
